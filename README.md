The original concept for *evolv\.io* comes from **[carykh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnv8QaEDL0)**

# Summary
This version of *evolv\.io* is made with **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** and **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)**. You can open it in your browser **[here](http://unknowngames.dx.am/project/evolvio/)**!

This version of *evolv\.io* uses an **[LSTM](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)** [neural net](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/what-is-an-artificial-neural-network/) to simulate creatures evolving over time. It is very basic at the moment, but may become more complex as we continue to work on it.
